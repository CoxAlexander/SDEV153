        <p>Every pokemon species has different base stats, these stats can affect how each pokemon can play out. However there are hidden stats that can 
        raise or decrease stats in different ways.</p>
        <h3>Effort Values (EVs)</h3>
        <p>EVs are stats that are gained when defeating different pokemon. A single pokemon can have 510 effort values with a total of 252 in a single stat. 
        Every 4 effort values in one stat increases the stat total by 1, meaning that the stat can at max be increased by 63 points. These stats can allow 
        for different styles of play be played within the same pokemon. Effort values are one way to have customizablity within competitive pokemon.</p>
        <h3>Indivdual Values (IVs)</h3>
        <p>IVs are values that start with the pokemon that range from 1 to 31. The value of an IV is 1 stat point when the pokemon is at level 100. IVs
        are valuable to increase the stats marginally and give an advatange to the stats</p>
        <h3>Nature</h3>
        <p>A pokemons nature affects 2 seperate stats. A pokemon's nature increases one stat by 10% and decreases another stat by 10%.<p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>While these stat increases are not major by themselves, adding them all together when making a pokemon can significantly stronger 
        than its counterparts.</p>
