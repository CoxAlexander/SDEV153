        <h3>Formats</h3>
        <p>There are many different formats that must be considered when deciding how you want to play the game. The main 2 formats are doubles and singles, the difference being how many pokemon are out on the field at one time. However, there are still many different rule sets for each mode.</p>
        <h3>Smogon</h3>
        <img src="images/smogon logo.jpg" alt="The logo for the smogon tiering system" width="42" height="42">
        <p>Smogon is an unoffical community made way to organize pokemon into different tiers so that pokemon of similar strength are used against other pokemon of similar strength. Smogon rules are also used to try to make the game as fair as possible so there are clauses that try to balance the game for both players. Such clauses include the no one hit kill moves and no endless battle clause, which are both designed to try to make the battles on average as fun as possible for both players.</p>
        <h3>VGC</h3>
        <img src="images/vgc logo.jpg" alt="The logo for the offical pokemon VGC competitions" width="42" height="42">
        <p>Video Game Championship or VGC is the offical competetive form of pokemon that is supported by the company. This format is always doubles however the rules can change slightly between years as they introduce new pokemon into the games. The consistent rules are speices clause and item clause where no duplicates of each can be present on a team. The difference between VGC and Smogon is that there is no tiers to seperate pokemon in vgc, so all pokemon have to fight other pokemon that are stronger than them in everyway possible.</p>
        <h3>Others</h3>
        <P>There are other formats that tend to be based of Smogon and VGC, however these are the main two that are used by the community as a base. If the game is supported offically by the pokemon company they tend to run rules similar to VGC, if the format is made by the community it tends to be more towards Smogon rules.</P>
