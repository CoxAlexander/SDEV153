        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <p>There are many different core strategies when it comes to pokemon that become better and worse depending on the available in the current games. There are several different types of strategies that all have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
        <h3>Full Offense</h3>
        <p>Full offense is a strategy that takes into the philosphy that a good offense is a good defense, forgoing all typical defenseive measures to try to overwealm and break done defenses quickly. This is a very risky strategy as if the opponet can work around the attacks than your team will fall just as quickly. The goal of this team style is to end the game as quickly as possible.</p>
        <h3>Defense</h3>
        <P>This is the opposite of offense, this is based on taking as little damage as possible and slowing chipping away at your opponet until they lose. This style utilizes a lot of passive damage such as entry hazards and status conditions to do damage as the opponet can't get your pokemon off the field.</P>
        <h3>Balanced</h3>
        <p>Implements both componets of offense  and defense, usually using 2 or 3 defenseive pokemon that can be used to pivot your offense pokemon in and out of battle. This is the most typical style of team as it covers both teams weaknesses as long as all pokemon are alive, however losing a defensive pokemon in the battle can cause the backbone of the team to fall apart, and cause you to be sweeped if the opponet has the right pokemon.</p>
        <h3>Trick Room</h3>
        <p>Trick room teams use the move trick room to make their bulky defensive pokemon move first as turn order is reversed, this can be a devistating style in trick room as it mixes full offense with defense as the pokemon that benefit from trick room the most are slow and bulky. These teams succeed in trickroom, but can fall apart outside of trick room, so making sure that you can deal with the trick room setter is very important on any team.</p>
        <h3>Perish Trap</h3>
        <P>Perish Trap is a very specific team style that relies on the move perish song to kill all pokemon in the field that heard the song to faint in 3 turns and a trapping method that keeps the pokemon on the field till the last turn. This team style is not very popular, but can be tricky to work around. Getting rid of the trapping pokemon is the most important part to deal with these teams.</P>
        <h3>Others</h3>
        <p>There are other team strategies that are specific to a certain pokemon or game mechanic that is specific to a generation, so will not be covered here, as it is too specific. The ones listed above will always be used in modern competetive pokemon.</p>
