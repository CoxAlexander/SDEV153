        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>There are many different small tips and tricks that are useful in competetive pokemon.</p>
        <h3>Speed Control</h3>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of competetive pokemon is speed control, because if you can move first and knock out the pokemon, that pokemon loses its chance to make a move. There are several ways to have speed control including, trick room, tailwind, sticky webb, and choice scarf.</p>
        <h3>Set Up Moves</h3>
        <p>In the base game set up moves are not that important, in competetive pokemon increasing stats of your pokemon can cause a win in the game. A pokemon setting up and becoming a deadly sweeper can be more important than just getting damage out.</p>
        <h3>Minimum Attack</h3>
        <p>If your pokemon uses special attack to do damage, it is optimal to the absoulte lowest attack stat on that pokemon for 2 reasons, confusion damage and foul play. Both confusion and foul play use the pokemon taking damage's attack stat, so having lower attack stat minimizes the damage from these sources.</p>
        <h3>Priority</h3>
        <p>Keeping track of what pokemon can learn moves that have increased priority is important, as priority moves while weaker typically, change the move order and can have a major affect on the battle.</p>
        <h3>Hidden Type Advantages</h3>
        <p>Keeping track of pokemon types that have advantages outside of weaknesses, such as grass types being immune to powder moves, and dark types being immune to prankster moves is very important to keep track of.</p>
        <h3>Meta</h3>
        <p>Always taking note of what pokemon is used a lot in the meta and making sure you team can deal with the many threats that are present in the meta is very important when building a team.</p>
